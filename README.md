# Felipes Spotify Playlist Maker

### Before we start

Did not have much time to add documentation or Clean the code up, but application is fully functional and performant.

Some Rework could be done to authentication, and add some Database to persist data insted of using localstorage, or redux state management

But for the purpose of this test we will use the very basics

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

Will run Front end on port 3000 and Server on 8000
